# AIML_learning

###This repository hosts a Google Colab notebook where I learned about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML). I conducted data preprocessing, data visualization and classification tasks using various datasets to explore and gain a better understanding of different machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project served as a practical learning experience in AIML concepts and tools.
